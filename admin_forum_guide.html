<h1>How does it Work ?</h1>
<p><strong>Any Body can View Your Posts</strong> Public Forum <em> means its contents</em> are visible to all.</p>
<ul>
  <li>So people may judge the Institute By Your Posts</li>
  <li>Prospective Students may want to have a Look</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Post ?</h2>
<p>Just Fill the HTML Form and Write ! Don't worry about Space ! Your Post will be first reviewed by Site's Admin and then if it gets ratified ( Of Course It will ,if Nothing is Nasty :) ),then it's there On Site.</p>
<h3>Hey! Still Not On Site</h3>
<p><strong>Admin</strong> is taking his/her time .Just Wait Till Your Post Gets Approved<em> Check Out Later </em>  </p>
<h3>Nope! It's Not There</h3>
<p><strong>Well, Admin didn't Approve it.</strong> Still, We hope you would keep posting <em> to keep this Community Alive.</em> </p>
